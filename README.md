# khonsubase

Khonsubase is a lightweight project management and knowledgebase collaboration tool written in [rust](https://rust-lang.org/).

This project's aim is to provide an easy-to-self-host solution that requires few resources to run.

## Requirements

- PostgreSQL 11+ (Might work with previous versions, but is untested)
- Amazon S3-compatible Storage Bucket to enable attachments
